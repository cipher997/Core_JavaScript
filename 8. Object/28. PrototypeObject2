      function Mobile() {}
      // Creating a new Object using new keyword
      var lg = new Mobile();
      // This will show undefined becoz a is neither defined in the funtion nor in the function's prototype
      // it first checks if lg object have property a as it doesn't have it so it go to its prototype object pointed by __proto__ and ask him if he has property a as it also doesn't have it so finally we receive undefined. This is how it works behind the browser and JS Engine is the responsible for this task
      console.log(lg.a);
